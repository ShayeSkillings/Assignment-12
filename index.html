            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>1. Remove starter from fridge, and add 1 part starter, 2 parts water, and 2 parts flour (1:2:2 ratio). Allow to rise on the counter at room temperature for ~8 hours or once doubled in size.</p>
            <p>2. Once active and bubbly(doubled in size), pour 100g into a mixing bowl, then add 375g warm water and stir. Add 500g flour and 10g salt and mix until a shaggy dough is formed.</p>
            <p>3. Cover with a damp kitchen towel and let rest for 30 minutes.</p>
            <p>4. After 30 minutes, stretch and fold the dough. Gently grab one side and pull upwards, folding the dough over itself towards the middle. Repeat until a rough ball is formed (about 5 stretches and folds). Perform stretch and folds once every 30 minutes, 2-4 time.</p>
            <p>5. After stretching and folding, allow to bulk rise on the counter for 8-12 hours.</p>
            <p>6. Once the dough has doubled in size, place it onto a lightly floured surface and shape. Using a bench scraper or your hands, push the dough forward and pull back towards yourself, rotating until a ball is formed.</p>
            <p>7. Place the shaped dough into a floured proofing basket seam side up. Stitch the seam closed. Rest on the counter for 30 minutes.</p>
            <p>8. After 30 minutes, place in fridge and allow to proof for 2-24 hours (this helps the dough hold its shape)</p>
            <p>9. When you’re ready to bake, place your Dutch oven into the oven, and preheat to 550°F.</p>
            <p>10. While the oven is preheating, remove your dough from the fridge. Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit your Dutch oven, and lightly flour. Invert the proofing basket to release the dough onto the parchment paper.</p> 
            <p>11. Flour the top of your dough, and using razor blade, score the dough however you wish. It is important to make a 1/4 inch deep expansion score to ensure the dough doesn’t fuse back together and burst in random spots.</p>
            <p>12. Once preheated, remove your Dutch oven from the oven, lower the oven temperature to 450ºF, and place your prepared dough into the Dutch oven.</p>
            <p>13. Place the lid on your Dutch oven and bake in the oven for 30 minutes. </p>
            <p>14. After 30 minutes, lower the oven temperature to 400ºF and remove the lid. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden.</p>
           <p>15. Remove from over and cool your loaf for at least 1 hour before slicing.</p>
           <p>16. Enjoy!</p>
