                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>500g bread flour</li>
                    <li>375g warm water</li>
                    <li>100g sourdough starter</li>
                    <li>10g salt</li>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>1. Remove starter from fridge, and add 1 part starter, 2 parts water, and 2 parts flour (1:2:2 ratio). Allow to rise on the counter at room temperature for ~8 hours or once doubled in size. <img src="step1.jpg" alt="Step 1"></li>
                    <li>2. Once active and bubbly (doubled in size), pour 100g into a mixing bowl, then add 375g warm water and stir. Add 500g flour and 10g salt and mix until a shaggy dough is formed. <img src="step2.jpg" alt="Step 2"></li>
                    <li>3. Cover with a damp kitchen towel and let rest for 30 minutes. <img src="step3.jpg" alt="Step 3"></li>
                    <li>4. After 30 minutes, stretch and fold the dough. Gently grab one side and pull upwards, folding the dough over itself towards the middle. Repeat until a rough ball is formed (about 5 stretches and folds). Perform stretch and folds once every 30 minutes, 2-4 times. <img src="step4.jpg" alt="Step 4"></li>
                    <li>5. After stretching and folding, allow to bulk rise on the counter for 8-12 hours. Once the dough has doubled in size, place it onto a lightly floured surface and shape. Using a bench scraper or your hands, push the dough forward and pull back towards yourself, rotating until a ball is formed. <img src="step5.jpg" alt="Step 5"></li>
                    <li>6. Place the shaped dough into a floured proofing basket seam side up. Stitch the seam closed. Rest on the counter for 30 minutes. <img src="step6.jpg" alt="Step 6"></li>
                    <li>7. After 30 minutes, place in fridge and allow to proof for 2-24 hours (this helps the dough hold its shape). <img src="step7.jpg" alt="Step 7"></li>
                    <li>8. When you’re ready to bake, place your Dutch oven into the oven, and preheat to 550°F. <img src="step8.jpg" alt="Step 8"></li>
                    <li>9. While the oven is preheating, remove your dough from the fridge. Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit your Dutch oven, and lightly flour. Invert the proofing basket to release the dough onto the parchment paper. <img src="step9.jpg" alt="Step 9"></li>
                    <li>10. Flour the top of your dough, and using a razor blade, score the dough however you wish. It is important to make a 1/4 inch deep expansion score to ensure the dough doesn’t fuse back together and burst in random spots. <img src="step10.jpg" alt="Step 10"></li>
                    <li>11. Once preheated, remove your Dutch oven from the oven, lower the oven temperature to 450ºF, and place your prepared dough into the Dutch oven. <img src="step11.jpg" alt="Step 11"></li>
                    <li>12. Place the lid on your Dutch oven and bake in the oven for 30 minutes. <img src="step12.jpg" alt="Step 12"></li>
                    <li>13. After 30 minutes, lower the oven temperature to 400ºF and remove the lid. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden. <img src="step13.jpg" alt="Step 13"></li>
                    <li>14. Remove from the oven and cool your loaf for at least 1 hour before slicing. <img src="step14.jpg" alt="Step 14"></li>
                    <li>15. Enjoy! <img src="step15.jpg" alt="Step 15"></li>
